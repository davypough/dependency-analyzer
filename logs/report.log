MAINTENANCE CONSIDERATIONS (reference logs/anomalies.log for details)
------------------------------

Duplicate Definitions (27):
    The following symbols are defined in multiple files:
    • *PARAM1*, *SHADOWED-VAR*, *SPECIAL1*, +CONST1+, COPY-POINT, FN1, GF1, GF2, INVALID-POINT, MAKE-POINT, MY-COMB, NAMED-POINT, POINT, POINT-ERROR-REASON, POINT-ERROR-VALUE, POINT-NAME, POINT-P, POINT-U, POINT-V, POINT-X, POINT-Y, POS-INTEGER, SETF, SETF, SETF, SHADOWED-FUNC, TODAY

    Duplicate definitions overwrite previous definitions making bugs difficult to trace.

Type Dependency Cycles (1):
    • Complex type dependency cycle detected: CLASS-A -> CLASS-B -> CLASS-C -> CLASS-A

    Cyclical type relationships become harder to reason about, increasing the likelihood of subtle semantic errors.

Shadowed Definitions (4):
    • Definition of SHADOWED-FUNC shadows inherited symbol from INTERNAL-TEST-PKG
    • Definition of *SHADOWED-VAR* shadows inherited symbol from INTERNAL-TEST-PKG
    • Definition of SHADOWED-FUNC shadows inherited symbol from INTERNAL-TEST-PKG
    • Definition of *SHADOWED-VAR* shadows inherited symbol from INTERNAL-TEST-PKG

    Shadowing can create subtle runtime behavior based on which definition is active in a given context.

Constant Naming Issues (1):
    • Constant MY-CONST defined without plus-sign convention (+MY-CONST+)

    Constants typically follow the +CONST+ naming convention.

Special Variable Naming Issues (2):
    • Special variable MY-PARAM defined without earmuffs convention (*MY-PARAM*)
    • Special variable MY-VAR defined without earmuffs convention (*MY-VAR*)

    Special variables typically follow the *VAR* naming convention.

Package Cohesion Issues (1):
    • Package INTERNAL-TEST-PKG provides core functionality to 1 other packages (4 refs)

    Such packages may have too many responsibilities, becoming hard to reason about systematically.

External Dependency Issues (15):
    • Package EXTERNAL-HEAVY-PKG owns only 0% of its symbols, relying on 2 external packages
    • Package CYCLE-PKG-C owns only 0% of its symbols, relying on 1 external packages
    • Package CYCLE-PKG-B owns only 0% of its symbols, relying on 1 external packages
    • Package CYCLE-PKG-A owns only 0% of its symbols, relying on 1 external packages
    • Package SHADOWING-TEST-PKG owns only 0% of its symbols, relying on 2 external packages
    • Package RUNTIME-PKG-C owns only 0% of its symbols, relying on 1 external packages
    • Package RUNTIME-PKG-B owns only 0% of its symbols, relying on 1 external packages
    • Package RUNTIME-PKG-A owns only 0% of its symbols, relying on 1 external packages
    • Package TEST5-PKG owns only 0% of its symbols, relying on 1 external packages
    • Package TEST4-PKG owns only 0% of its symbols, relying on 3 external packages
    • Package TEST3-PKG owns only 0% of its symbols, relying on 3 external packages
    • Package TEST2-PKG owns only 0% of its symbols, relying on 1 external packages
    • Package TEST1-PKG owns only 0% of its symbols, relying on 1 external packages
    • Package ALEXANDRIA owns only 28% of its symbols, relying on 1 external packages
    • Package USER-PKG owns only 10% of its symbols, relying on 2 external packages

    Packages with low symbol ownership may have unclear boundaries or excessive coupling.

Unused Package Imports (6):
    • Package SHADOWING-TEST-PKG imports INTERNAL-TEST-PKG but doesn't use any of its symbols
    • Package TEST4-PKG imports TEST1-PKG but doesn't use any of its symbols
    • Package TEST4-PKG imports ALEXANDRIA but doesn't use any of its symbols
    • Package T3PKG imports ALEXANDRIA but doesn't use any of its symbols
    • Package TEST3-PKG imports ALEXANDRIA but doesn't use any of its symbols
    • Package USER-PKG imports ALEXANDRIA but doesn't use any of its symbols

    Consider removing unnecessary imports to clarify dependencies.

Symbol Visibility Issues (4):
    The following internal symbols are referenced with package qualification:
    • reference to internal symbol INTERNAL-TEST-PKG::*INTERNAL-VAR*
    • reference to internal symbol INTERNAL-TEST-PKG::INTERNAL-FUNCTION

    Consider exporting these symbols or restructuring the packages.
